# 🚀 Cosmic Valentine Proposal ❤️

A spectacular, interactive web experience designed to pop the question in style! This single-page application features cinematic animations, a dynamic starfield, immersive audio, and a playful "No" button that refuses to be clicked.

## ✨ Features

- **🌌 Cinematic Intro**: A stunning portal transition effect when the answer is "YES!".
- **⭐ Dynamic Starfield**: Procedurally generated stars and shooting stars with a warp speed effect upon clear success.
- **🖱️ Interactive Cursor**: A glowing cursor trail with "stardust" particles that react to movement.
- **🚫 The Unclickable "No"**: The "No" button actively evades the cursor, taunting the user with fun phrases like *"Think again!"* and *"You're my Love ;)"*.
- **🔥 Escalating Intensity**: If the user persists, the "YES" button grows larger and eventually unleashes a **"GET OVER HERE!!"** mode with intense visual effects.
- **🎵 Immersive Audio**:
  - Background loop (`waiting.mp3`)
  - Sound effects for interactions (`get-over-here.mp3`, `yay.mp4`)
  - Cinematic finale music (`shooting-stars.mp3`)
- **🎬 Grand Finale**: A supernova video transition leading to a warping starfield and a glowing success message.
